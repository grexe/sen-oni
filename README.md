# SEN Default Ontology

This ontology defines a useful standard set of common types found in a default Haiku installation, like:
* Person,
* E-Mail,
* Calendar Entry,
* Text,
* Audio,
* Image,
* Document,
* Source Code
* Bookmark

Where possible, existing types are reused, or extended with needed properties, along with suitable relations.
